## Tech Stack

| Layer       | Technology                                                   |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend    | React 18, React Router v6, Tailwind CSS, Vite                |
| Backend     | Python Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, Flask-SocketIO  |
| Real-time   | Socket.IO (WebSockets)                                       |
| Database    | **PostgreSQL** (via psycopg2-binary + SQLAlchemy)            |

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Node.js 18+** — https://nodejs.org (LTS version)
- **PostgreSQL 13+** — https://www.postgresql.org/download/

---

## Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

### Option A — pgAdmin (GUI)

1. Open **pgAdmin** → Servers → right-click → **Create › Database**
2. Name it `ticketflow`, click **Save**

### Option B — psql CLI

```bash
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE ticketflow;
\q
```

### Configure the connection

```bash
# Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set your credentials:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/ticketflow
SECRET_KEY=any-long-random-string
```

> Tables are **created automatically** on first run via `db.create_all()`.  
> No manual migrations are needed for a fresh install.

---

## Setup & Run

### 1 — Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2 — Start the Flask backend (Terminal 1)

```bash
python app.py
```

> Runs on **http://localhost:5000**  
> On first start, all tables are created in the `ticketflow` database automatically.

### 3 — Start the React frontend (Terminal 2)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install      # first time only
npm run dev
```

> Runs on **http://localhost:5173**

Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

> **The first registered account automatically becomes the Administrator.**

## Migrating from SQLite (existing data)

If you have existing data in `tickets.db` and want to move it to PostgreSQL:

1. Install `pgloader` — https://pgloader.io  
2. Run:

```bash
pgloader sqlite:///tickets.db postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/ticketflow
```

3. Update `.env` with your PostgreSQL `DATABASE_URL` and restart Flask.

## Roles & Permissions

| Role         | What they can do |
|--------------|------------------|
| **User**        | Submit tickets · comment · delete own Open/In-Progress tickets · view own ticket history |
| **IT Personnel** | All User actions + claim unassigned tickets + update ticket status + assigned queue |
| **Admin**       | All IT Personnel actions + manage users + reset passwords + archive tickets + view reports |

---

## Sample Workflow — End to End

### Step 1 — Register accounts

1. Open http://localhost:5173/register
2. Register the **first account** (becomes Admin automatically)
3. Register a second account and choose role **IT Personnel**
4. Register a third account and choose role **User**

### Step 2 — User submits a ticket

1. Log in as **User**
2. Click **New Ticket** in the sidebar
3. Fill in:
   - **Title**: "Printer not working on 3rd floor"
   - **Category**: Support
   - **Priority**: High
   - **Description**: detailed description
   - **Assign to IT Personnel**: select the IT Personnel account
4. Click **Submit**

### Step 3 — IT Personnel resolves the ticket

1. Log in as **IT Personnel**
2. Go to **My Queue** — the ticket appears there
3. Open the ticket → add a comment explaining the fix
4. Change **Status** → **Resolved**
5. The Admin receives an automatic notification: *"it_support resolved ticket TKT-00001"*

### Step 4 — Admin reviews and archives

1. Log in as **Admin**
2. Open the **Notification bell** → see the resolution notification
3. Go to **All Tickets** → select the resolved ticket → click **Archive**
4. The ticket moves to the **Archive** tab (read-only)

### Step 5 — Admin generates a Report

1. Go to **Reports** (Admin sidebar)
2. The report loads data from the same dataset as **All Tickets**
3. Select a **Month** from the dropdown (e.g., *March 2026*) to filter by period
4. Toggle **By Week / By Month** to change the timeline grouping
5. Review the charts:
   - **Tickets by Status** — see how many are Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed
   - **Tickets by Category** — see which categories are most common
   - **Tickets by Priority** — Critical / High / Medium / Low breakdown
   - **Resolved by Personnel** — who resolved the most tickets
   - **Tickets per Week / Month** — volume over time
6. Click **Export Summary** → downloads an aggregated CSV
7. Click **Export CSV** → downloads every ticket row with full details
